For the Pandas Challenge I had to utilized these set of skills to find the solution to the top perentage of the schools by different criteria.

* Serve Jupyter Notebook files from local directories and connect to their development environment. 

* Create Pandas DataFrames from scratch. 

* Run functions on Pandas DataFrames. 

* Read and write DataFrames to and from CSV files by using Pandas. 

* Navigate through DataFrames by using `loc` and `iloc`. 

* Filter and slice Pandas DataFrames. 

* Create and access Pandas GroupBy objects. 

* Sort DataFrames. 

* Merge DataFrames and distinguish between inner, outer, left, and right merges.

* Slice data by using the `cut()` method and create new values based on a series of bins.

* Fix common Python/Pandas bugs in Jupyter Notebook.
